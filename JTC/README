This directory contains code used for parameter estimation for the
Jumping-to-Conclusions task.

The code statically links two libraries, which are under the 'cc' directory: GSL
2.4 (GNU Scientific Library), and Blitz++. Both are released under their own
licenses, and are only provided in this repository to make compilation easy, and
the resulting binary reproducible.

GSL was obtained from:
http://ftp.heanet.ie/mirrors/gnu/gsl/gsl-2.4.tar.gz

Blitz++ was obtained from:
https://codeload.github.com/blitzpp/blitz/legacy.tar.gz/1.0.1
